# Text-Extractor
To explain the code for a "Text Extractor" and its flow in layman terms, let's break it down into simple steps:

---

### **What Does a Text Extractor Do?**
A text extractor is a program or tool that can extract readable text from various sources, like:
- PDF documents
- Images
- Scanned files

It can be useful for tasks like pulling text from a document for analysis or searching through the content.

### **How Does the Code Typically Work?**

#### 1. **Input (Getting the File or Image)**
- The program starts by asking the user to provide a file (e.g., PDF, image, or document).
- For example, the user might upload a file like "invoice.pdf" or "photo.jpg".

   **Example:** 
   - A file picker is opened, or the user types the file path.

---

#### 2. **Reading the File**
- The program reads the content of the file.
   - If it’s a PDF, it will go page by page to read the text.
   - If it’s an image, it will use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and extract the text.

   **Layman Explanation:** 
   Imagine you have a digital magnifying glass that reads the words on a page or in an image and converts them into editable text.

---

#### 3. **Processing the Text**
- The extracted text might need cleaning or formatting.
   - Removing unnecessary spaces, extra characters, or unwanted symbols.
   - Sometimes, the text is split into paragraphs or lines for better readability.

   **Layman Explanation:**
   It’s like cutting off the extra edges of a photo to make it neat and presentable.

---

#### 4. **Displaying or Saving the Output**
- The processed text is displayed to the user or saved into a file.
   - It can be shown on the screen or saved as a `.txt` or `.docx` file.

   **Layman Explanation:**
   Imagine the tool gives you a neat notepad file of what it read from the document or image.

### **Flow of the Code**

1. **Start:**
   - User opens the program.

2. **Input File:**
   - The program asks for a file (e.g., PDF or image).

3. **Extract Text:**
   - If it’s a PDF, it uses libraries like `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber`.
   - If it’s an image, it uses OCR tools like `Tesseract`.

4. **Process Text:**
   - Clean and organize the extracted text.

5. **Output:**
   - Show the text on the screen or save it to a file.

6. **End:**
   - User gets the final text and can close the program.

---

### **Example Use Case**
- **You have a scanned image of a receipt**: The program reads the image, extracts the text, cleans it up, and gives you the details like date, items, and price.
- **You have a PDF resume**: It extracts all the text so you can edit or analyze it without manually copying everything.
